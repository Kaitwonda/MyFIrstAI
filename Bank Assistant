### Bank Assistant – Friendly AI for Chaotic Workplaces

**Every corporate job is hectic.**
The chain of command for reporting tech issues is murky.
Updates happen when you least expect them.
And the people dealing with it? Usually under-supported.

**Bank Assistant** is a small, polished AI project designed not to replace jobs, but to help the people already doing them. Inspired by real experience working IT support in a local bank environment, this AI models the *tone*, *logic*, and *chaotic rhythms* of everyday tech support inside corporate infrastructure.

The goal is **efficient, friendly, and emotionally-aware flow control**:

* It responds clearly to user requests
* Offers light encouragement when frustration is detected
* Navigates support questions like “Why is my phone unregistered?” or “Who handles port security violations?”

While this project won’t access real systems, it’s built to simulate realistic architecture:
Fake biometric paths, mock third-party vendor logic, and server routing decisions are all part of the environment map—without referencing any actual data or infrastructure.

This may eventually include small data tests, but the core focus is interaction design and flow clarity. Tone is light but professional. Think “calm co-worker, not corporate chatbot.”

### Model + Stack

The assistant will use **LLaMA 3 (8B)** for its core logic and conversational tone, running locally via **llama.cpp** or **Ollama** for lightweight, private deployment. This model provides:

* Tunable responses for clear yet supportive dialogue
* Open-source access for flexibility and transparency
* Long context window for processing extended interactions

**Dependencies & Tools:**

* [LLaMA 3 weights](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama) (8B or 13B)
* [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) or [Ollama](https://ollama.com) for deployment
* Python 3.10+ and optional Flask or FastAPI for frontend integration
* Prompt templates with embedded soft flow control logic (likely YAML or JSON schema)

This project will probably be included in my **first AI assistant suite**, but is documented here as a standalone concept for flow control experimentation and tone modeling.
