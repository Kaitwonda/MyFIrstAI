# 🏦 Bank Assistant
## Friendly AI for Chaotic Workplaces

## 🌪️ The Corporate Reality

**Every corporate job is hectic.** 

Let's face it:
- The chain of command for reporting tech issues is murky
- Updates happen when you least expect them
- Support staff are usually under-resourced and overwhelmed
- Documentation exists... somewhere

## 💼 What is Bank Assistant?

**Bank Assistant** is a small, polished AI project designed not to replace jobs, but to help the people already doing them. It was inspired by real experience working IT support in a local bank environment, where this AI models the *tone*, *logic*, and *chaotic rhythms* of everyday tech support inside corporate infrastructure.

## 🎯 The Core Mission

The goal is **efficient, friendly, and emotionally-aware flow control**:
- It responds clearly to user requests
- Offers light encouragement when frustration is detected
- Navigates support questions like "Why is my phone unregistered?" or "Who handles port security violations?"

## 🏗️ The Simulation Environment

While this project won't access real systems, it's built to simulate realistic architecture:
- Fake biometric paths
- Mock third-party vendor logic
- Server routing decisions
- Support ticket escalation flows

All of these are part of the environment map—without referencing any actual data or infrastructure.

This may eventually include small data tests, but the core focus is on interaction design and flow clarity. The tone is light but professional. Think "calm co-worker, not corporate chatbot."

## 🛠️ Model & Technical Stack

The assistant will use **LLaMA 3 (8B)** for its core logic and conversational tone, running locally via **llama.cpp** or **Ollama** for lightweight, private deployment.

### 🧠 Core Model Benefits

- Tunable responses for clear yet supportive dialogue
- Open-source access for flexibility and transparency
- Long context window for processing extended interactions

### 🔧 Dependencies & Tools

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| [LLaMA 3 weights](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama) (8B or 13B) | Base language model |
| [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) or [Ollama](https://ollama.com) | Local deployment runtime |
| Python 3.10+ | Core programming language |
| Flask or FastAPI (optional) | Web interface integration |
| YAML/JSON schema | Prompt templates with soft flow control |

## 🔮 System Architecture

### Conversation Flow Layer

### Support Routing Simulation

```

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

1. **Core Conversation Model Setup**
   - Install llama.cpp or Ollama
   - Configure base model parameters
   - Design initial prompt template

2. **Support Knowledge Base Creation**
   - Map typical IT support paths
   - Create mock biometric workflows
   - Design vendor integration points

3. **Emotional Intelligence Layer**
   - Develop frustration detection patterns
   - Create supportive response templates
   - Implement escalation recognition

4. **Testing & Refinement**
   - Create test conversations
   - Refine response patterns
   - Optimize flow control logic

## 💡 Sample Use Cases

### Password Reset Flow
```
User: "I can't log into the teller system after the update"
Assistant: "I understand that's frustrating, especially during a busy day. The teller system update changed the authentication method. Would you like me to:
1. Guide you through the new login process
2. Connect you with the password reset portal
3. Create a ticket for IT support (est. response: 15-20 min)"
```

### Department Routing
```
User: "Who handles port security violations?"
Assistant: "Port security violations are handled by the Network Security team. 
Your local contact is the IT Security Liaison (ext. 4775). 
For urgent issues, the Security Operations Center is available 24/7 at ext. 8000.
Would you like me to note this inquiry for the Security team?"
```

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

This project will likely be included in my **first AI assistant suite**, but is documented here as a standalone concept for flow control experimentation and tone modeling.

Future enhancements might include:
- Simple voice integration for hands-free operation
- Expanded knowledge base of common banking systems
- Integration with training documentation
- Light process documentation capabilities

## ✨ Why This Matters

In high-pressure environments like banking, having a calm, consistent support presence can make all the difference. Bank Assistant isn't trying to replace human IT support—it's giving them the breathing room to focus on the complex problems by handling the routine questions with empathy and clarity.

It's about making chaotic workplaces a little more manageable, one interaction at a time.
