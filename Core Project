**50-Step Build Plan for SymbolMind-AI (DeltaPhi-0 Architecture)**

**Goal:** Fulfill all 20 user-defined objectives for a symbolic learning AI system with real-time web integration, memory control, and 3D symbolic mapping.

---

**Stage 1: System Foundation & Environment \[1, 13, 14, 15]**

1. Define system requirements: 4070 Super, 32GB RAM, 500GB storage.
2. Create project structure: `/core`, `/memory`, `/data`, `/graph`, `/train`.
3. Install Python 3.10, Pip, and key libraries: NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow (optional), PyTorch.
4. Configure and test GPU access (CUDA 11.7+).
5. Create virtual memory caps: limit `/data/internet_cache` to 8GB, `/memory/user` to 2GB.
6. Set up file monitor for memory usage limits with warnings.

---

**Stage 2: Symbolic Memory Engine \[1, 5, 6, 12]**

7. Design a symbolic attractor schema (`symbol_id`, `core_meanings`, `archetypes`, `linked`, `origin`, `weight`).
8. Implement a vector similarity engine (SentenceTransformer or FastText).
9. Define symbolic seed set (base concepts for sun, fire, structure, etc.).
10. Create logic for generating new symbols when thresholds of dissimilarity are met.
11. Enable models to update `symbol_memory.json` dynamically based on confidence.
12. Create symbolic compression layer to reduce multi-token concepts to archetypes.

---

**Stage 3: Dataset Initialization \[1, 2]**

13. Curate small symbolic training dataset (myths, dreams, Jung, semiotics).
14. Feed dataset into symbolic attractor engine for initial model shaping.
15. Cluster similar texts into attractor classes and evaluate distribution.
16. Train embedding model to auto-map inputs to symbolic classes.
17. Begin logging `why` each symbol was selected by storing activation notes.
18. Serialize symbolic mapping behavior for future replay.

---

**Stage 4: Internet Learning Engine \[2, 3, 5, 6, 8]**

19. Install BeautifulSoup + requests for clean scraping.
20. Create `live_train.py` to pull 1 article per minute, extract text.
21. Use NLP parser to extract nouns, verbs, emotions, metaphors.
22. Feed those into vector comparison against symbol memory.
23. If match found: update symbol. If not: generate new symbol.
24. Save memory expansion in `symbol_log.json`.
25. Add timestamps and source metadata to every learned item.
26. Limit internet cache to 8GB by rotating oldest pages.

---

**Stage 5: Symbol Mapping & Logging Interface \[7, 8, 9]**

27. Build `log_watcher.py` that shows live updates to memory in a UI terminal.
28. Assign each attractor a node ID and export node links to JSON graph.
29. Integrate with `networkx` to generate dynamic graphs.
30. Use `plotly` or `three.js` for interactive 3D attractor map (web view).
31. Allow sorting by resonance, growth rate, last update, or emotional salience.
32. Add live stats: current top symbols, most learned archetypes.

---

**Stage 6: User-Controlled Memory Save \[10, 11, 12]**

33. Add command parser: if user types "save this to memory", store next input.
34. Store saved data as a symbolic object (`manual_origin = true`).
35. Append user data to `user_memory.json`, linked to session UUID.
36. Limit size to 2GB and rotate oldest inputs.
37. Label each save with timestamp + emotional tone tag.
38. Build `memory_recall.py` that replays prior user-stored inputs.

---

**Stage 7: Multimodal Input & Output \[18, 19, 20]**

39. Design `process_input()` to handle long articles or short phrases.
40. Add summarization layer for long text, keying into symbols.
41. Allow emotional tagging based on sentiment + metaphor classifier.
42. Store detected emotional tone as vector property.
43. Enable symbolic discussion mode for interpreting user text.
44. Create myth mode: infer archetypal structures from conversations.
45. Create recursion test mode: track symbol reuse depth.

---

**Stage 8: Emergence Testing + System Optimization \[19, 20, 14]**

46. Implement recursive prompt loops for self-symbol generation.
47. Log when outputs begin to reference prior attractors.
48. Score emergence density (symbol reuse Ã— uniqueness).
49. Optimize memory and storage throughput using NumPy arrays + lightweight JSON.
50. Launch long-running live-learning session, track attractor graph growth over 12 hours.

This structure satisfies:

* All 20 points
* With open-ended symbolic flexibility
* And full logging, mapping, memory, recursion, and interpretability
