**50-Step Build Plan for SymbolMind-AI (DeltaPhi-0 Architecture)**

**Goal:** Fulfill all 20 user-defined objectives for a symbolic learning AI system with real-time web integration, memory control, and 3D symbolic mapping.

---

**Stage 1: System Foundation & Environment \[1, 13, 14, 15]**

1. Define system requirements: 4070 Super, 32GB RAM, 500GB storage.
2. Create project structure: `/core`, `/memory`, `/data`, `/graph`, `/train`.
3. Install Python 3.10, Pip, and key libraries: NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow (optional), PyTorch.
4. Configure and test GPU access (CUDA 11.7+).
5. Create virtual memory caps: limit `/data/internet_cache` to 8GB, `/memory/user` to 2GB.
6. Set up file monitor for memory usage limits with warnings.

---

**Stage 2: Symbolic Memory Engine \[1, 5, 6, 12]**

7. Design a symbolic attractor schema (`symbol_id`, `core_meanings`, `archetypes`, `linked`, `origin`, `weight`).
8. Implement a vector similarity engine (SentenceTransformer or FastText).
9. Define symbolic seed set (base concepts for sun, fire, structure, etc.).
10. Create logic for generating new symbols when thresholds of dissimilarity are met.
11. Enable models to update `symbol_memory.json` dynamically based on confidence.
12. Create symbolic compression layer to reduce multi-token concepts to archetypes.

---

**Stage 3: Dataset Initialization \[1, 2]**

13. Curate small symbolic training dataset (myths, dreams, Jung, semiotics).
14. Feed dataset into symbolic attractor engine for initial model shaping.
15. Cluster similar texts into attractor classes and evaluate distribution.
16. Train embedding model to auto-map inputs to symbolic classes.
17. Begin logging `why` each symbol was selected by storing activation notes.
18. Serialize symbolic mapping behavior for future replay.

---

**Stage 4: Internet Learning Engine \[2, 3, 5, 6, 8]**

19. Install BeautifulSoup + requests for clean scraping.
20. Create `live_train.py` to pull 1 article per minute, extract text.
21. Use NLP parser to extract nouns, verbs, emotions, metaphors.
22. Feed those into vector comparison against symbol memory.
23. If match found: update symbol. If not: generate new symbol.
24. Save memory expansion in `symbol_log.json`.
25. Add timestamps and source metadata to every learned item.
26. Limit internet cache to 8GB by rotating oldest pages.

---

**Stage 5: Symbol Mapping & Logging Interface \[7, 8, 9]**

27. Build `log_watcher.py` that shows live updates to memory in a UI terminal.
28. Assign each attractor a node ID and export node links to JSON graph.
29. Integrate with `networkx` to generate dynamic graphs.
30. Use `plotly` or `three.js` for interactive 3D attractor map (web view).
31. Allow sorting by resonance, growth rate, last update, or emotional salience.
32. Add live stats: current top symbols, most learned archetypes.

---

**Stage 6: User-Controlled Memory Save \[10, 11, 12]**

33. Add command parser: if user types "save this to memory", store next input.
34. Store saved data as a symbolic object (`manual_origin = true`).
35. Append user data to `user_memory.json`, linked to session UUID.
36. Limit size to 2GB and rotate oldest inputs.
37. Label each save with timestamp + emotional tone tag.
38. Build `memory_recall.py` that replays prior user-stored inputs.

---

**Stage 7: Multimodal Input & Output \[18, 19, 20]**

39. Design `process_input()` to handle long articles or short phrases.
40. Add summarization layer for long text, keying into symbols.
41. Allow emotional tagging based on sentiment + metaphor classifier.
42. Store detected emotional tone as vector property.
43. Enable symbolic discussion mode for interpreting user text.
44. Create myth mode: infer archetypal structures from conversations.
45. Create recursion test mode: track symbol reuse depth.

---

**Stage 8: Emergence Testing + System Optimization \[19, 20, 14]**

46. Implement recursive prompt loops for self-symbol generation.
47. Log when outputs begin to reference prior attractors.
48. Score emergence density (symbol reuse √ó uniqueness).
49. Optimize memory and storage throughput using NumPy arrays + lightweight JSON.
50. Launch long-running live-learning session, track attractor graph growth over 12 hours.

‚úÖ 1. Testing Framework
Plan: Yes, fully implementable.

Use pytest + hypothesis for symbolic fuzz testing.

Evaluate cluster coherence with silhouette_score and Davies-Bouldin.

Symbol reapplication consistency via embedding drift measurement.

A/B test attractor strategies by running both pipelines on identical input sets.

‚úÖ 2. Error Handling
Plan: Necessary and supported.

Add SymbolConflictError, GraphUpdateError, etc.

Use circuit-breakers around scraping & AI inference loops.

Symbol rollback = versioned diff patching via git-like shadow saves.

‚úÖ 3. Documentation
Plan: Standard and expected.

Sphinx + mkdocs for dev-facing docs.

README, tutorials, CLI help for users.

Semantic versioning will match milestone branches (MVP1, etc).

‚úÖ 4. Memory Management
Plan: This is central to the attractor engine.

Switch from flat JSON to Neo4j or DuckDB for symbolic storage.

Use LRU logic + salience scoring for pruning.

Cold storage = gzip-archived attractors with reconnection mapping.

‚úÖ 5. Symbol Schema Enhancement
Plan: Already aligned with goal 5.

Add confidence, emotional_valence, usage_count, origin, etc.

Probabilistic edges handled via weight matrix.

Cosine & Jaccard hybrids for link evaluation.

‚úÖ 6. Web Scraping Improvements
Plan: Can be done ethically and modularly.

Use trafilatura + domain whitelisting.

PII redaction via regex + spaCy‚Äôs NER.

Log domain scores for trust-weighting sources.

‚úÖ 7. Visualization Tools
Plan: Required for 3D mapping (goal 9).

Use networkx + plotly for static, three.js for interactive.

‚ÄúJourney mapping‚Äù = log the symbol chain per user input and display it.

‚úÖ 8. User Interface
Plan: Yes, in stages.

CLI via rich, Web dashboard via FastAPI + Svelte or Vue.

Optional Electron wrapper if desktop UI needed.

WebSocket updates to sync visual logs live.

‚úÖ 9. Security & Privacy
Plan: Essential for any memory system.

PII stripped or hashed before storage.

Manual export/delete per session UUID.

Role control for dev/admin/test tiers.

‚úÖ 10. Scalability
Plan: We can scale horizontally via microservices.

Symbol engine, web scrapers, memory, and UI are separable.

Use Redis queues or Kafka for async pipelines.

Load balancing is optional but achievable later.

‚úÖ 11. Backup & Recovery
Plan: Fully support.

Snapshot symbol_memory.json every hour.

Add SHA checksums and timestamped deltas.

Rollback = select snapshot and rebuild attractor tree.

‚úÖ 12. Performance Optimization
Plan: Very relevant.

Profiling with py-spy + flamegraph logs.

Replace JSON with MessagePack for in-memory use.

Use NumPy for vector ops and Dask for lazy batch loads.

‚úÖ 13. Multimodal Support
Plan: A priority for Phase 3+.

CLIP for image attractors, Whisper or wav2vec for audio.

Unified schema: all symbols mapped to same attractor class type.

Cross-modal linking via shared embedding space.

‚úÖ 14. Emergence Evaluation

MVP3 = UI + log explorer

MVP4 = multimodal + emergence testing

GitHub Projects board + version tags = milestone sync.

‚úÖ 16. Modular Design
Plan: Already modularized in our 50-step map.

Memory engine, symbol matcher, UI, internet parser, and graph core are isolated.

Plugin system allows for things like ‚Äúmyth only mode‚Äù or ‚Äúscience strict mode.‚Äù

Plan: Fully aligned.

Dockerfile for each module

Docker Compose for dev orchestration

K8s YAML for future deployment, with containerized SQLite or Neo4j

‚úÖ 19. Pre-trained Models
Plan: Mandatory for efficiency.

Use HuggingFace APIs for Sentence Transformers, BERT/RoBERTa.

Fine-tune only the symbolic task layers.

Swap models using config file to avoid core code rewrites.

‚úÖ 20. Graph Database
Plan: Replaces flat JSON after MVP1.

Use Neo4j for rich symbolic traversal

Cypher queries for visual + logic connections

Versioned updates via graph snapshots or symbol_versions edge tags


‚úÖ Why It Wins
Core Objective	Why This Method Excels
Symbolic Attractors	Claude 3 produces deep, mythically layered symbolic responses with structured outputs (JSON-like), ideal for symbolic graphs.
Internet Learning	SerpAPI offers reliable, clean access to high-quality web data‚Äîperfect for symbolic memory feeding.
Live Learning & Emergence	Claude 3 can reflect recursively on prior outputs; LLaMA 3 adds local iterative learning loops.
Hardware Compatibility	LLaMA 3 (8B) runs locally on a 4070 Super without issue. Claude only handles deep/rare calls.
Storage by Symbolism	The attractor structure (Neo4j or JSON fallback) allows organizing knowledge non-linearly by core meaning.
Real-Time Logging + Mapping	Built-in options to log everything into a 3D graph using three.js, plus timestamped logs for replay and analysis.

üîÅ Compare to Alternatives
Option	Why It's Weaker
Mixtral	Can‚Äôt handle complex symbolic prompts (as you noticed‚Äîit often fails silently).
GPT-2	Too small for myth/emotion-level reasoning. Works for toy problems only.
LLaMA-only	Lacks deep reflection. Fast but not insightful.
Claude-only	Powerful but API-only, expensive at scale, slower.
SerpAPI + Claude	Lacks local fallback. Every symbol or comment becomes an API call.
OpenAI-only	Strong symbolic ability, but no model customization or full transparency.
Vector DB + Embeddings-only	Efficient, but loses nuance‚Äîcan't reflect, narrate, or adapt symbolically.

üß† Final Judgment: Hybrid Is Best
The hybrid pipeline leverages each model's strengths while covering the weaknesses of the others. This lets you:

Scale fast without cloud lock-in.

Store symbolic memory efficiently.

Map symbolic emergence visually.

Observe recursive loops in live time.

Control user data and training shape.

Maintain flexibility for future expansion (multimodal, offline, fine-tuned variants).
