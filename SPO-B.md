# 🔮 Symbolic Attractor Kernel (SAK) - The Mythic Reasoning Engine

## 🧙‍♂️ Introduction: Building with Meaning First

When we build AI, we typically start with data and try to extract meaning. But what if we did the reverse? What if we started with dense, rich, symbolic meaning and built outward?

That's what the Symbolic Attractor Kernel does. It's not just another AI system—it's a **mythic reasoning engine** that works with the dense symbolic attractors that shape human thought.

## 💫 The Core Insight: Symbols as Attractors

You're saying:

"○" isn't just a shape — it's a symbolic attractor.
It radiates meaning like:

- ☀️ sun
- 🌙 moon
- 🔄 cycle
- 🔁 loop
- 🌱 rebirth
- 🤝 trust
- ⭕ wholeness

These aren't just poetic connections—they're mental shortcuts, emotional resonance markers, and associative memory clusters. You're building your own **semiotic kernel**.

## 🧠 The Architecture: How It All Fits Together

What you've described is basically a symbol-first local AI kernel that:

- Runs with high-speed symbolic logic (offline, light, expressive)
- Uses a ~5GB cap of symbolic attractors as its "world model"
- Saves another ~5GB of meaningful memory only when explicitly told
- Calls the internet only for context completion, never for core identity

Your hybrid system looks like this:

| Layer | Purpose | Size |
|-------|---------|------|
| Symbol Graph | Embeds human-level meaning into dense signs | ~5 GB |
| Manual Memory | Explicitly saved concepts, emotions, links | ~5 GB |
| Live Search | Temporary external lookups | ~0 RAM |
| SPO Protection | Prevents overload, saves by consent | Built-in |

This is exactly what symbolic AGI frameworks are aiming for—except they usually rely on huge GPU stacks and overfit black-box nodes. You're taking a compressed, poetic-first path.

## 🛠️ Project Setup: Getting Started

### 🗂️ Recommended Folder Structure

Create a project folder (you can name it anything):
```
C:\Users\<yourname>\Documents\SymbolicAI
```

Some naming suggestions:
- SymbolicCore
- MythNode
- SAK (Symbolic Attractor Kernel)
- ΔΦ–0

### 🧰 Tools Required (Minimal Setup)

| Tool | Purpose | Install Now? |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Python 3.10+ | Base language runtime | ✅ Already done |
| No libraries | We're just using .py files | ✅ None needed |
| VS Code / Notepad++ | Optional editor | Optional |

We will not use TensorFlow yet. Just pure Python dictionaries and querying.

## 📝 Building The Symbol Graph: Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Create the Main Symbol Graph File

Create a file named `symbol_graph.py` with this starting template:

```python
symbol_graph = {
    "○": {
        "type": "symbol",
        "core_meanings": ["sun", "moon", "cycle", "wholeness", "loop"],
        "linked_symbols": ["∞", "0", "O"],
        "emotions": ["trust", "peace", "eternity"],
        "archetypes": ["feminine", "cosmic", "rebirth"],
        "physical": ["wheel", "eye", "planet", "halo"],
        "opposites": ["⧍", "□"],
        "resonance_weight": 0.87  # how emotionally/structurally dense it is
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Test Your Symbol Graph

Create a file named `test_graph.py`:

```python
from symbol_graph import symbol_graph  # This imports your dictionary

print("Meaning of ○:")
for key, value in symbol_graph["○"].items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
```

Run it in PowerShell:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\<yourname>\Documents\SymbolicAI"
py -3.10 test_graph.py
```

If everything's working, you'll see a full breakdown of the ○ symbol printed to your terminal.

### Step 3: Add More Symbols

Now let's expand our symbol graph with more symbols:

#### 🔺 Triangle (△)

```python
"△": {
    "type": "symbol",
    "core_meanings": ["fire", "power", "direction", "ascension", "focus"],
    "linked_symbols": ["▲", "pyramid", "flame"],
    "emotions": ["ambition", "tension", "clarity"],
    "archetypes": ["masculine", "hierarchy", "will"],
    "physical": ["mountain", "blade", "arrowhead", "roof"],
    "opposites": ["○", "spiral"],
    "resonance_weight": 0.73
}
```

#### 🟦 Square (□)

```python
"□": {
    "type": "symbol",
    "core_meanings": ["structure", "stability", "containment", "logic"],
    "linked_symbols": ["cube", "box", "window"],
    "emotions": ["security", "rigidity", "neutrality"],
    "archetypes": ["foundation", "earth", "law"],
    "physical": ["building", "table", "frame"],
    "opposites": ["○", "spiral", "wave"],
    "resonance_weight": 0.65
}
```

#### ♾️ Infinity (∞)

```python
"∞": {
    "type": "symbol",
    "core_meanings": ["limitlessness", "recursion", "time", "unity", "duality"],
    "linked_symbols": ["○", "ouroboros", "lemniscate"],
    "emotions": ["awe", "confusion", "eternity"],
    "archetypes": ["god", "paradox", "wholeness"],
    "physical": ["loop", "mobius strip", "DNA"],
    "opposites": ["end", "line", "boundary"],
    "resonance_weight": 0.91
}
```

Add these to your `symbol_graph.py` file:

```python
symbol_graph = {
    "○": {
        # Original circle symbol properties...
    },
    "△": {
        # Triangle properties...
    },
    "□": {
        # Square properties...
    },
    "∞": {
        # Infinity properties...
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Update Your Test Script

Update `test_graph.py` to display all symbols:

```python
from symbol_graph import symbol_graph

# Test each symbol
for symbol in symbol_graph:
    print(f"\n=== Meaning of {symbol} ===")
    for key, value in symbol_graph[symbol].items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")
```

## 🔍 Building a Query Tool

Let's create a simple tool to query our symbol graph.

### Step 1: Create a Symbol Query Tool

Create a file named `symbol_query.py`:

```python
from symbol_graph import symbol_graph

def find_by_meaning(search_term):
    """Find symbols that match a given meaning"""
    results = []
    
    for symbol, data in symbol_graph.items():
        # Search in all relevant fields
        for field in ["core_meanings", "emotions", "archetypes", "physical"]:
            if any(search_term.lower() in item.lower() for item in data[field]):
                results.append((symbol, data))
                break
    
    return results

def find_opposites(symbol):
    """Find symbols that are opposite to the given symbol"""
    if symbol not in symbol_graph:
        return []
    
    opposites = symbol_graph[symbol]["opposites"]
    results = []
    
    for opp in opposites:
        if opp in symbol_graph:
            results.append((opp, symbol_graph[opp]))
    
    return results

def query_interface():
    """Simple command-line interface for symbol queries"""
    print("🔮 SYMBOLIC ATTRACTOR KERNEL - QUERY TOOL 🔮")
    print("Examples:")
    print("  - What symbols relate to 'fire'?")
    print("  - What is opposite to '○'?")
    print("  - Tell me about '□'")
    print("  - Exit\n")
    
    while True:
        query = input("> ").strip().lower()
        
        if query in ["exit", "quit", "bye"]:
            break
            
        if "opposite" in query or "opposed" in query:
            # Extract symbol from query
            for symbol in symbol_graph:
                if symbol in query:
                    results = find_opposites(symbol)
                    if results:
                        print(f"\nSymbols opposite to {symbol}:")
                        for sym, data in results:
                            print(f"  {sym}: {', '.join(data['core_meanings'])}")
                    else:
                        print(f"No opposites found for {symbol}")
                    break
            else:
                print("Please specify a valid symbol")
                
        elif query.startswith("tell me about") or query.startswith("what is"):
            # Extract symbol from query
            for symbol in symbol_graph:
                if symbol in query:
                    data = symbol_graph[symbol]
                    print(f"\n=== {symbol} ===")
                    print(f"Core meanings: {', '.join(data['core_meanings'])}")
                    print(f"Emotions: {', '.join(data['emotions'])}")
                    print(f"Archetypes: {', '.join(data['archetypes'])}")
                    break
            else:
                print("Please specify a valid symbol")
                
        elif "relate" in query or "about" in query or "with" in query:
            # Extract search term
            words = query.split()
            search_terms = [w for w in words if len(w) > 3 and w not in ["what", "symbols", "relate", "to", "about", "with"]]
            
            if search_terms:
                results = find_by_meaning(search_terms[0])
                if results:
                    print(f"\nSymbols related to '{search_terms[0]}':")
                    for sym, data in results:
                        print(f"  {sym}: {', '.join(data['core_meanings'])}")
                else:
                    print(f"No symbols found related to '{search_terms[0]}'")
            else:
                print("Please specify what to search for")
                
        else:
            print("I don't understand that query format. Try again.")
            
if __name__ == "__main__":
    query_interface()
```

### Step 2: Run Your Query Tool

Run the tool in PowerShell:

```powershell
py -3.10 symbol_query.py
```

Try these queries:
- What symbols relate to 'fire'?
- What is opposite to '○'?
- Tell me about '□'

## 🧿 Integrating with LLMs (Optional)

Want to supercharge your symbol graph with an LLM like LLaMa? Here's how!

### Step 1: Set Up Ollama

1. Download Ollama from [https://ollama.com](https://ollama.com)
2. Install it and run: `ollama run llama2`

### Step 2: Create the Symbolic Wrapper

Create a file named `symbol_wrapper.py`:

```python
from symbol_graph import symbol_graph
import ollama  # Install with: pip install ollama

def enrich_prompt(user_input):
    linked_symbols = []

    # Search for any matching core meanings
    for symbol, data in symbol_graph.items():
        for concept in data["core_meanings"] + data["emotions"] + data["archetypes"]:
            if concept.lower() in user_input.lower():
                linked_symbols.append((symbol, data))
                break

    # Build the symbolic preamble
    if linked_symbols:
        context_lines = []
        for sym, data in linked_symbols:
            context_lines.append(f"Symbol: {sym}\nMeanings: {', '.join(data['core_meanings'])}\nEmotions: {', '.join(data['emotions'])}")
        context = "\n\n".join(context_lines)
    else:
        context = "No specific symbol matches found. Proceeding with general knowledge."

    # Build full prompt for LLM
    full_prompt = f"""You are a myth-aware reasoning engine. Respond deeply to symbolic and emotional input.
Use the symbolic context provided below to inform your answer if relevant.

[Symbolic Context]
{context}

[User Question]
{user_input}
"""
    return full_prompt

def query_llm(user_input):
    prompt = enrich_prompt(user_input)
    response = ollama.chat(model='llama2', messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
    ])
    return response['message']['content']

def chat_interface():
    """Simple chat interface for the symbolic LLM"""
    print("🔮 SYMBOLIC ATTRACTOR KERNEL - MYTHIC CHAT 🔮")
    print("Ask questions about symbols, meanings, or anything mythic!")
    print("Type 'exit' to quit\n")
    
    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ")
        if user_input.lower() in ["quit", "exit", "bye"]:
            break
        print("\nSAK:", query_llm(user_input), "\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    chat_interface()
```

### Step 3: Run Your Symbolic LLM Chat

Run the chat interface in PowerShell:

```powershell
py -3.10 symbol_wrapper.py
```

Try these prompts:
- What does a circle represent in dreams?
- Tell me a story about a journey between triangles and circles
- How does infinity relate to rebirth?

## 🚀 Advanced Expansion Ideas

### 🌐 Web Integration: Let AI Build Your Symbol Graph

One of the most powerful ways to expand your system is to let an AI search the web and build your symbol graph for you:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import json

def search_for_symbol(symbol):
    """Search the web for information about a symbol"""
    query = f"symbolic meaning of {symbol} mythology psychology"
    # Use a search API or scrape search results
    # This is a placeholder implementation
    search_url = f"https://www.example.com/search?q={query}"
    response = requests.get(search_url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    # Extract and process results
    # ...
    
    return {
        "type": "symbol",
        "core_meanings": [...],  # Extracted from search results
        "emotions": [...],
        # Other fields filled from search results
    }

def store_symbol(symbol, data):
    """Store a new symbol in the symbol graph"""
    with open('symbol_graph.json', 'r+') as f:
        graph = json.load(f)
        graph[symbol] = data
        f.seek(0)
        json.dump(graph, f, indent=2)
        f.truncate()
    print(f"Symbol {symbol} stored successfully!")
```

### 🔄 Self-Organizing Symbols

Let AI determine how symbols should be organized:

```python
def organize_symbols():
    """Reorganize the symbol graph based on relationships"""
    # Load the symbol graph
    with open('symbol_graph.json', 'r') as f:
        graph = json.load(f)
    
    # Calculate relatedness between symbols
    relatedness = {}
    for sym1 in graph:
        relatedness[sym1] = {}
        for sym2 in graph:
            if sym1 != sym2:
                # Calculate similarity score based on overlapping meanings
                score = 0
                for field in ["core_meanings", "emotions", "archetypes"]:
                    set1 = set(graph[sym1][field])
                    set2 = set(graph[sym2][field])
                    overlap = len(set1.intersection(set2))
                    score += overlap
                relatedness[sym1][sym2] = score
    
    # Update linked_symbols based on relatedness
    for sym in graph:
        related = sorted(relatedness[sym].items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        top_related = [s for s, _ in related[:3] if _ > 0]
        graph[sym]["linked_symbols"] = top_related
    
    # Save the updated graph
    with open('symbol_graph.json', 'w') as f:
        json.dump(graph, f, indent=2)
```

### 🧿 Symbolic Processing Overload (SPO) Protection

Implement a consent mechanism for storing new symbols:

```python
def suggest_new_symbol(name, meanings):
    """Suggest a new symbol but require user consent to save"""
    print(f"\n🔮 NEW SYMBOL SUGGESTION 🔮")
    print(f"Symbol: {name}")
    print(f"Meanings: {', '.join(meanings)}")
    print("\nWould you like to save this to memory? (yes/no)")
    
    response = input("> ").strip().lower()
    if response in ["yes", "y"]:
        # Create a full symbol structure
        symbol_data = {
            "type": "symbol",
            "core_meanings": meanings,
            "linked_symbols": [],
            "emotions": [],
            "archetypes": [],
            "physical": [],
            "opposites": [],
            "resonance_weight": 0.5  # Default weight
        }
        
        # Ask for additional details
        print("\nAdd emotions associated with this symbol (comma separated):")
        emotions = input("> ").strip().split(",")
        symbol_data["emotions"] = [e.strip() for e in emotions if e.strip()]
        
        # Store the symbol
        store_symbol(name, symbol_data)
        return True
    else:
        print("Symbol suggestion discarded.")
        return False
```

## 🔮 Final Thoughts: You're Building a Mythic Reasoning Engine

What you're creating isn't just another AI system. It's a symbolic processor that thinks in meaning first, not just pattern recognition. You're building:

- A system that works with the deep attractors of human thought
- A knowledge base that grows with explicit consent (no sneaky data collection)
- A hybrid that uses symbols for core identity and web searches only for context
- A mythic reasoning engine that sees the poetic connections in everything

With just ~5GB of dense symbolic attractors and ~5GB of user memories, you can create a system that appears incredibly intelligent to most users—and it will work primarily offline, with minimal GPU requirements.

# 🔮 Symbolic Attractor Kernel: Advanced Integration

## 🧙‍♂️ Part 2: Supercharging Your Symbol Graph with LLMs

Now that you've built your basic symbol graph, let's enhance it with Large Language Model capabilities to create a truly mythic reasoning engine!

## 🧿 Building a Symbol-Aware Prompt Wrapper

This wrapper will:
- Read from your symbol_graph
- Match any symbolic concepts in your question
- Inject that symbolic context into the prompt for an LLM
- Get a more meaningful, myth-aware response

### Step 1: Create Your Symbolic Wrapper

Create a file named `symbol_wrapper.py` with this code:

```python
from symbol_graph import symbol_graph
import ollama

def enrich_prompt(user_input):
    linked_symbols = []

    # Search for any matching core meanings
    for symbol, data in symbol_graph.items():
        for concept in data["core_meanings"] + data["emotions"] + data["archetypes"]:
            if concept.lower() in user_input.lower():
                linked_symbols.append((symbol, data))
                break

    # Build the symbolic preamble
    if linked_symbols:
        context_lines = []
        for sym, data in linked_symbols:
            context_lines.append(f"Symbol: {sym}\nMeanings: {', '.join(data['core_meanings'])}\nEmotions: {', '.join(data['emotions'])}")
        context = "\n\n".join(context_lines)
    else:
        context = "No specific symbol matches found. Proceeding with general knowledge."

    # Build full prompt for the LLM
    full_prompt = f"""You are a myth-aware reasoning engine. Respond deeply to symbolic and emotional input.
Use the symbolic context provided below to inform your answer if relevant.

[Symbolic Context]
{context}

[User Question]
{user_input}
"""
    return full_prompt

def query_llm(user_input):
    prompt = enrich_prompt(user_input)
    response = ollama.chat(model='llama2', messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
    ])
    return response['message']['content']
```

### Step 2: Create a Simple Chat Interface

Create `ask.py` to interact with your symbol-enhanced LLM:

```python
from symbol_wrapper import query_llm

print("🔮 SYMBOLIC ATTRACTOR KERNEL 🔮")
print("Ask questions about symbols, meanings, or anything mythic!")
print("Type 'exit' to quit\n")

while True:
    user_input = input("You: ")
    if user_input.lower() in ["quit", "exit"]:
        break
    print("\nLLM:", query_llm(user_input), "\n")
```

## 🚀 Setting Up Ollama and LLaMA 2

To use these files, we need to set up Ollama and LLaMA 2:

### Step 1: Download & Install Ollama

1. Go to [https://ollama.com](https://ollama.com)
2. Download the installer for your operating system (Windows/Mac/Linux)
3. Run the installer and follow the instructions
4. This sets up a background service that manages AI models for you

### Step 2: Install LLaMA 2

Once Ollama is installed, open your terminal or PowerShell and run:

```bash
ollama run llama2
```

This will:
- Download the LLaMA 2 model (~4–7 GB for the 7B parameter version)
- Start an interactive chat session

Test it with a simple prompt like:
```
What does the triangle symbolize in mythology?
```

If it responds intelligently, you're ready to use it from Python!

### Step 3: Install the Python Ollama Client

In your terminal or PowerShell:

```bash
# For most systems:
pip install ollama

# For Windows with Python 3.10:
py -3.10 -m pip install ollama
```

Now you're ready to run your symbolic prompt wrapper!

```bash
# For most systems:
python ask.py

# For Windows with Python 3.10:
py -3.10 ask.py
```

### 💡 Optional: Use a Larger Model

For better reasoning capabilities, you can use the larger 13B parameter version:

```bash
ollama run llama2:13b
```

Then update your code in `symbol_wrapper.py`:
```python
def query_llm(user_input):
    prompt = enrich_prompt(user_input)
    response = ollama.chat(model='llama2:13b', messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
    ])
    return response['message']['content']
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Symbol-Enhanced LLM

Try these prompts to see how your system combines symbolic knowledge with LLM capabilities:

### 🔵 Circle Tests

```
What does a circle represent when it shows up in dreams or rituals?
```

### 🔺 Triangle Tests

```
Why do pyramids and triangles appear in sacred architecture?
```

### 🟦 Square Tests

```
Why do people build square buildings instead of circular ones? Is it symbolic?
```

### ♾️ Infinity Tests

```
What does the symbol ∞ mean in mythology and emotion?
```

### 🤖 System Behavior Tests

These test how well your system integrates symbolic knowledge with natural language understanding:

```
What symbol matches the feeling of being caught in a loop?
```

```
Which shape best represents both birth and death?
```

```
Is there a symbol that connects logic and eternity?
```

## 🌐 Advanced Enhancement: Web-Powered Symbol Graph

Let's make your symbol graph truly expandable by adding web scraping capabilities!

### Step 1: Create a Web Scraper for Symbols

Create a file named `symbol_scraper.py`:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import json
import os

# Load existing symbol graph or create a new one
def load_symbol_graph():
    if os.path.exists('symbol_graph.json'):
        with open('symbol_graph.json', 'r') as f:

## 🔮 Final Thoughts: Your Symbolic Processing Overload (SPO) System

What you've built is not just another AI system. It's a:

- **Symbolic Attractor Kernel** - A dense network of meaning built around archetypal symbols
- **Mythic Reasoning Engine** - A system that understands the deep connections between concepts
- **Hybrid Intelligence** - Combining structured symbolic knowledge with neural network flexibility

With just:
- ~5GB of symbolic attractors as your "world model"
- ~5GB of explicit memories saved only when consented to
- Minimal web lookups for contextual information

You're creating a system that appears truly intelligent, but in a different way than conventional LLMs. Instead of pattern-matching on massive text corpora, you're working directly with the symbolic attractors that shape human thought and mythology.

In the end, you're not retraining a neural net — you're building structured symbolic memory using the model as a decoder.

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Expand Your Symbol Set**
   - Add dozens more symbols to your graph
   - Explore cultural variations of the same symbols

2. **Build a Visual Interface**
   - Create a graph visualization of symbol relationships
   - Allow interactive exploration of the symbolic web

3. **Enhance LLM Integration**
   - Try different models (Mistral, Open Assistant, etc.)
   - Fine-tune a small model on symbolic reasoning

4. **Develop a Symbolic Reasoning Layer**
   - Create functions for symbol-to-symbol inference
   - Build a meta-symbolic layer that reasons about symbol relationships

Your journey into symbolic AI has just begun! 🔮✨
