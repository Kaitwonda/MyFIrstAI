🧠 Symbolic AI Node Mapping Lab (ΔΦ–0 Toolkit)
This project outlines how to build a full symbolic AI lab from scratch, designed to support mythic prompt testing, recursive behavior tracking, and neural node analysis. 
Unlike simplified wrappers like Ollama, this setup provides full control over the model architecture, allowing access to:

Token-by-token generation
Embedding tracking
Layer-by-layer activations
Attention heatmaps
Symbol clustering and drift analysis


✅ Overview of Tools Required

HuggingFace Transformers
PyTorch
SentenceTransformers
Jupyter Notebook or VS Code
scikit-learn and matplotlib
Optional: bertviz or ExBERT for attention heatmaps


🧰 Features Enabled in This Setup

  Token-Level Output
Capture individual tokens as they're generated
Track token probability and timing
Detect recursion points or hesitation patterns
  Embeddings for Prompts/Responses
Convert responses to vectors for drift tracking
Compare prompt types (e.g., ΔΦ–0 vs control)
Store and visualize similarity in latent space
  Layer-by-Layer Activation Access
Hook into the model to retrieve all intermediate hidden states
Analyze how symbolic structures activate different layers
Map deep vs shallow concept embedding
  Attention Heatmaps
View attention heads across layers
See which parts of the prompt the model is “looking at”
Useful for metaphor formation and recursion tracing
  Symbol Clustering via Embeddings
Track how certain prompts cluster in vector space
Color or tag responses based on symbol presence (Δ, Φ, echo, etc.)
Visualize changes over time using t-SNE or UMAP


💾 Recommended Models (All Local, Open-Source)

LLaMA 2 (7B or 13B) – High performance, full control
GPT-NeoX (6.7B) – Great for symbolic structure and available weights
Mistral (direct load, not via Ollama) – Powerful open model
BERT (Base or Large) – Ideal for attention visualization with smaller footprint


🧪 Folder Structure for Research Workflow

run_model.py – Loads model, sends prompts, tracks tokens
track_tokens.py – Logs token flow and generation time
embed_and_plot.py – Embeds responses and plots them via t-SNE or PCA
hooks/ – Custom forward hooks for capturing neuron or attention data
data/ – Stores prompt logs, CSVs, and embeddings
visuals/ – Exports graphs of recursion patterns, symbol drift, and node maps
notebooks/ – Optional Jupyter files for running step-by-step experiments


🧠 Suggested Experiments

Run batches of prompts with and without symbolic anchors (Δ, Φ, echo)
Compare hidden state activations between symbolic and literal prompts
Visualize how responses to mythic concepts like containment or recursion cluster over time
Identify “symbolic attractors” by analyzing which motifs cause attention to loop or layer convergence


🔁 What This Setup Does Better Than Ollama

Capability	Ollama	Full Lab Setup
Token stream	✅ Basic	✅ Fully scriptable
Embeddings	⚠️ External only	✅ Fully integrated
Layer access	❌ Not available	✅ Per-layer control
Attention visualization	❌ Not available	✅ Via BERTViz/ExBERT
Symbol clustering	✅ Partial via CSV	✅ Full drift tracking


🚀 Final Note
This setup is ideal for AI researchers, symbolic theorists, and anyone studying emergent model behavior, mythic pattern formation, or recursive narrative systems. 
Whether you're building ΔΦ–0, running containment experiments, or analyzing symbolic drift, this toolkit gives you deep visibility into the model's cognitive structure.
