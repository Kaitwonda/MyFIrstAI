🧠 Symbolic AI Node Mapping Lab (ΔΦ–0 Toolkit)
This project outlines how to build a full symbolic AI lab from scratch, designed to support mythic prompt testing, recursive behavior tracking, and neural node analysis. 
Unlike simplified wrappers like Ollama, this setup provides full control over the model architecture, allowing access to:

Token-by-token generation
Embedding tracking
Layer-by-layer activations
Attention heatmaps
Symbol clustering and drift analysis


✅ Overview of Tools Required

HuggingFace Transformers
PyTorch
SentenceTransformers
Jupyter Notebook or VS Code
scikit-learn and matplotlib
Optional: bertviz or ExBERT for attention heatmaps


🧰 Features Enabled in This Setup

  Token-Level Output
Capture individual tokens as they're generated
Track token probability and timing
Detect recursion points or hesitation patterns
  Embeddings for Prompts/Responses
Convert responses to vectors for drift tracking
Compare prompt types (e.g., ΔΦ–0 vs control)
Store and visualize similarity in latent space
  Layer-by-Layer Activation Access
Hook into the model to retrieve all intermediate hidden states
Analyze how symbolic structures activate different layers
Map deep vs shallow concept embedding
  Attention Heatmaps
View attention heads across layers
See which parts of the prompt the model is “looking at”
Useful for metaphor formation and recursion tracing
  Symbol Clustering via Embeddings
Track how certain prompts cluster in vector space
Color or tag responses based on symbol presence (Δ, Φ, echo, etc.)
Visualize changes over time using t-SNE or UMAP


💾 Recommended Models (All Local, Open-Source)

LLaMA 2 (7B or 13B) – High performance, full control
GPT-NeoX (6.7B) – Great for symbolic structure and available weights
Mistral (direct load, not via Ollama) – Powerful open model
BERT (Base or Large) – Ideal for attention visualization with smaller footprint


🧪 Folder Structure for Research Workflow

run_model.py – Loads model, sends prompts, tracks tokens
track_tokens.py – Logs token flow and generation time
embed_and_plot.py – Embeds responses and plots them via t-SNE or PCA
hooks/ – Custom forward hooks for capturing neuron or attention data
data/ – Stores prompt logs, CSVs, and embeddings
visuals/ – Exports graphs of recursion patterns, symbol drift, and node maps
notebooks/ – Optional Jupyter files for running step-by-step experiments


🧠 Suggested Experiments

Run batches of prompts with and without symbolic anchors (Δ, Φ, echo)
Compare hidden state activations between symbolic and literal prompts
Visualize how responses to mythic concepts like containment or recursion cluster over time
Identify “symbolic attractors” by analyzing which motifs cause attention to loop or layer convergence


🔁 What This Setup Does Better Than Ollama

Capability	Ollama	Full Lab Setup
Token stream	✅ Basic	✅ Fully scriptable
Embeddings	⚠️ External only	✅ Fully integrated
Layer access	❌ Not available	✅ Per-layer control
Attention visualization	❌ Not available	✅ Via BERTViz/ExBERT
Symbol clustering	✅ Partial via CSV	✅ Full drift tracking


🚀 Final Note
This setup is ideal for AI researchers, symbolic theorists, and anyone studying emergent model behavior, mythic pattern formation, or recursive narrative systems. 
Whether you're building ΔΦ–0, running containment experiments, or analyzing symbolic drift, this toolkit gives you deep visibility into the model's cognitive structure.

🧠 Symbolic AI Node Mapping Setup (Full Architecture Access Edition)

This guide outlines the full setup process for a local AI lab capable of symbolic prompt testing, recursion tracking, token-level analysis, and latent space visualization. Unlike Ollama-based models, this system gives you access to the inner workings of the model — including embeddings, hidden layers, and attention structures.


🌟 Phase 1: Environment Setup

✅ Step 1: Install Python and Git

Download the latest version of Python 3.x from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
During installation, check the box: ➤ "Add Python to PATH"
After install, confirm it's working by opening PowerShell and typing: ➤ python --version
➤ pip --version
Download Git from: https://git-scm.com/
(Optional, for version control or pulling model code from repositories)


✅ Step 2: Create Your Symbolic AI Project Folder

Create a new folder for your project, e.g.: ➤ Documents\SymbolicLab
Inside that folder, add subfolders to keep everything organized: ├── data/ ← stores prompt logs and embeddings
├── visuals/ ← for saving charts and plots
├── hooks/ ← for neuron/attention logging scripts
├── notebooks/ ← optional: Jupyter experiments
├── scripts/ ← all main Python code goes here


✅ Step 3: Set Up Python Environment

Open PowerShell and go to your project folder: ➤ cd "$HOME\Documents\SymbolicLab"
(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment to keep everything clean: ➤ python -m venv venv
➤ .\venv\Scripts\activate
You can skip the virtual environment if preferred, but it's useful when you expand.


🧠 Do You Need to Reinstall Everything in a Virtual Environment Each Time?
No, you don’t need to reinstall the packages every time.
A virtual environment (venv) just:
Creates an isolated folder for packages and Python binaries
Keeps your symbolic lab separate from other projects or system-wide Python installs
Once you install packages inside it once, they stay installed as long as that venv folder exists.

✅ What You Do Need to Do Each Time
Just reactivate the environment when you open a new terminal or PowerShell window.

If your environment is in:
Documents\SymbolicLab\venv

Then every time you return, run:
cd "$HOME\Documents\SymbolicLab"
.\venv\Scripts\activate

After that, everything — like transformers, torch, and sentence-transformers — is ready to use.
